# Object_Following_Cart

An autonomous object-following cart created using Raspberry Pi, OpenCV, and Python. The cart was made in collaboration with four classmates. 

## My Contribution:

- Created a [skeleton](https://github.com/Pop0097/Object_Detection_Algorithm) for the object detection algorithm.
- Set up the Raspberry Pi 4B, assembled the cart chassis, designed both iterations of the electric circuit, and constructed the exterior chassis of the cart. 
- Developoped the PD controller class, logic to select desired motor spin directions, the macro that is triggered when the object leaves the video frame, and implemented PWM to vary motor output.
- Integrated all software modules together as hardware was in my posession.

## Hardware Components:

- Raspberry Pi 4B
- PiCamera V1
- L298N Motor Controller
- [Cart chassis](https://www.amazon.ca/perseids-Chassis-Encoder-Battery-Arduino/dp/B07DNXBFQN/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=car+chassis&qid=1607060404&sr=8-5)
- Power source (2.4 A, 5 V, DC)
